# linux-tkg-arch-script
A small, and probably useless script to install TkG's custom Linux kernel on Arch based distributions.

Change any options you want to in ```config.cfg```, run the ```compile.sh``` script, and when it asks you what config you would like to use, choose ```Other Desktop (Performance)```.
